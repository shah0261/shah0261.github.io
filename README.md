EVEYTHING (HTMLS, CSS, XD, README, ... IS ON THE MAIN REPOSITORY. (NOT ANY FOLDERS)

What I struggled with:

Bootstrap is fairly new for mee, so is javascript. It takes alot more pracive for me to get as comfrtable as html oand css. I still have to learn alot for them too, but its kind of easier now after lits of assignments. 

When i was making my nav bar, it wouldnt open in the mobile view after collapsing, it took me hours to figure it out that i had typos in my js.  

I learned about MarkDown files. I had no clue what a readme file is or how i can create them. simple but necessary to know and learn.
